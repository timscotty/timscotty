<p style="text-align: justify;">Define Your Competitors</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first step is to identify who your main competitors are. These should be companies that offer similar products or services to the target the same customer segment. Look beyond direct competitors to include the indirect ones too. For example, it could be if you're starting a burger restaurant, the competing food chains like sandwich shops or pizza places can be the rivals too.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Research Each Competitor</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once you have a list of the key competitors, do in-depth research on each one. Gather the details on products/services offered, pricing, target customers, market share, online presence, marketing messaging, competitive advantages, and more. This will give the insights into their positioning and also strategies.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Use public sources like the company's website, news articles, industry reports, and also financial filings to collect information. You can also speak to any contacts who may have insider knowledge. Capture key facts and figures in a detailed table to easily compare different attributes.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Analyze The Competitive Landscape</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With competitor research in place, you can now analyze the competitive landscape. Look for commonalities and differences across your rivals to identify the key success factors. For example, do highly profitable players share any strategies like premium pricing or niche targeting?</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Also look for gaps where the competitors are perhaps not serving the customers very effectively. Your new business could fill the gaps. For instance, if no one offers green cleaning products in your city, that presents a great opportunity.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Assess Your Competitive Advantage</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A competitive analysis also requires an honest assessment of your own company's many strengths and weaknesses relative to competitors. Ask critical questions like:

• What unique value will our business offer? How will we differentiate?
• Which customer needs can we best satisfy? Where are the biggest areas for the improvement?
• What resources and capabilities provide us an edge? Technology, special skills, distribution channels, partnerships, etc.
• What sustainable advantage will allow us to compete and gain major market share?</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Having clear answers builds a very compelling case for why your company will succeed amidst many rivals. It also guides the strategy and messaging.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Highlight Strategic Insights</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Distill your key learnings into 3-5 strategic insights to drive the business decisions and also planning. For example:

• Private label brands with low pricing have 43% market share revealing the price sensitivity among the customers.
• No competitor has robust technical support revealing an opportunity to attract many tech-savvy users through the superior customer service.
• Our patented enzyme formula provides 30% faster stain removal over the comparable products - a sustainable competitive edge over the rivals.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Such insights provide an analytical underpinning to craft the strategy, set the objectives and build the capabilities to beat the competitors. They will strengthen every section of your plan from the marketing to the operations.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Track Competition Over Time</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, keep tracking the competition periodically to account for the evolving landscape. Set news alerts on the key players or use tools like Google Alerts. Follow the industry reports and announcements for the latest developments including new product launches, mergers, marketing campaigns etc.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This will allow you to continually calibrate your business activities for your competitive advantage. You may identify new opportunities or nip any potential threats sooner. Make monitoring the competition an ongoing business discipline.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">With a rigorous competitive analysis guiding your hand, you can make strategic decisions to successfully get rid of rivals. It enables you to leverage your many differentiating strengths and find your firm footing in a very competitive landscape at every stage of business growth. So devote a lot of time upfront to really understand what you're up against before crafting your bold winning game plan.</p>
